MB diffractive Fracture Function

Neural Network determination of diffractive parton distribution functions in the framework of fracture functions


The objective of this study is to derive a new set of diffractive parton distribution functions (diffractive PDFs) 
through a comprehensive QCD analysis of the latest diffractive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) datasets obtained 
from the HERA \(ep\) collider. These newly extracted diffractive PDFs, termed LOVE2025, 
are determined at next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order 
(NNLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This work employs the fracture 
function methodology, a robust QCD framework designed to ensure a statistically consistent 
representation of diffractive DIS processes. Contributions from heavy quarks are accounted for 
using the variable flavor number scheme (VFNS).
A key innovation of this analysis is the incorporation of neural networks to model the 
dependence of the diffractive PDFs. The neural network-based approach allows for a more flexible 
and unbiased determination, enabling the data to be described without assuming an explicit functional form. 
This approach effectively captures intricate dependencies within the diffractive data, 
reducing biases and leading to improved precision in the extracted distributions. 
Furthermore, we present the extracted diffractive PDFs, highlighting their quality of fit and 
stability across variations in kinematic cuts and datasets. We also benchmark these new diffractive PDFs, 
derived through the fracture function framework, against other recent determinations and observe 
excellent overall agreement. 
Uncertainties on the diffractive PDFs are
calculated by means of the Monte Carlo sampling method properly accounting for all sources of experimental uncertainties. 
The approach features several novel aspects, including neural network 
determination of the diffractive PDFs, and a systematic strategy anchored in the full application of 
the QCD factorization theorem for diffractive hard processes.
