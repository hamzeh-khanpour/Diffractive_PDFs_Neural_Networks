Title : Neural Network determination of diffractive parton distribution functions in the framework of fracture functions


The objective of this study is to derive a new set of diffractive parton distribution functions (diffractive PDFs)
through a comprehensive QCD analysis of the latest diffractive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) datasets obtained
from the HERA \(ep\) collider. These newly extracted diffractive PDFs, dubbed {\tt MAP-diff-PDF1.0},
are determined at next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This work employs the fracture-function
methodology, a robust QCD framework for the description of diffractive DIS processes.
Contributions from heavy quarks are accounted for using a variable-flavor-number scheme (VFNS).
A key innovation of this analysis is the incorporation of neural networks to model the
dependence of the diffractive PDFs. The neural-network-based approach allows for a more flexible
and unbiased determination of diffractive PDFs, enabling the data to be described without assuming an explicit functional form.
This approach effectively reduces parametrization bias and leads to improved precision in the extracted distributions.
Uncertainties on the diffractive PDFs are calculated by means of Monte Carlo sampling,
properly accounting for all sources of experimental uncertainty.
Furthermore, we present the extracted diffractive PDFs, highlighting their quality of fit and
stability across variations in kinematic cuts and datasets. We also compare these new diffractive PDFs,
derived within the fracture-function framework, against other recent determinations and observe
acceptable overall agreement.
The diffractive PDFs obtained in this analysis are available in the standard {\tt LHAPDF} format.
